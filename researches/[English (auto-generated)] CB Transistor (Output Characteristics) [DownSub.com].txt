in the previous lecture I explained the

early effect and we obtained the input

characteristics of common base

transistor in this lecture we will

obtain the output characteristics of

common base transistor it is the

graphical relation between the output

current and the output voltage for

various levels of input current the

output characteristics is the graphical

relation between the output current

between the output current and the

output voltage output voltage for

various levels off for various levels of

input current levels of input current if

you see the common base configuration of

transistor you will find IC is the

output current and VC B is the output

voltage so output current is I see the

collector current and output voltage is

VC B VC B and the input current is ie

the emitter current

so we have to plot the graphical

relation between the collector current

IC voltage VC B for various levels of

ammeter current ie if we consider this

NPN transistor as two diodes connected

back to back it will look something like

this this is the first diode and this is

the second diode we want to plot the

output characteristics of common base

transistor in active region so the first

diode is forward biased and the second

diode is reverse biased current through

the second diode is IC the collector

current and voltage across this diode is

equal to VC B voltage across this diode

is equal to VC B so the output

characteristics is simply is simply the

reverse bias characteristics of diode

very simple you can see this diode is

reverse biased the current is IC the

same current has an output

characteristics and the voltage across

the diode is equal to VC be the same

voltage so the output characteristics of

common base transistor is simply the

reverse bias characteristics of PN

Junction diode the x-axis will represent

VC B and the y axis will represent IC IC

is measured in milliamps and VC B is

measured in volts the plot is very

simple it will be simply the reverse

bias characteristics of diode but the

important thing is variation of the plot

for different levels of input current

that is high E and we already know we

already know the collector current IC is

equal to alpha times ie plus I CBO where

I CBO is the reverse saturation current

or leakage current I CBO is very small

as compared to alpha times ie so we can

neglect I CBO and IC is nearly equal to

alpha times I

you can also see in this first equation

there is no VC beam so this is

independent independent of VC B now we

can consider the collector current IC

nearly equal to the emitter current ie

because alpha is from zero point nine

five two zero point nine eight which is

nearly equal to one so we can see that

the collector current is equal to the

emitter current so the output current

the output current is affected

tremendously by the input current when

input current the emitter current is

equal to zero milliamps then the output

current is nearly equal to zero

milliamps this is small current this a

small current is icbo

the reverse saturation current when IE

is equal to zero IC is equal to i CBO

this is when IE

is equal to zero milliamps when IE is

equal to let's say five milliamps high e

is equal to five milliamps the collector

current is nearly equal to five

milliamps and the plot will look like

this in the same way when emitter

current ie is equal to ten milliamps the

collector current is nearly equal to ten

milliamps and the plot will look like

this so this is the output

characteristics of the common base

transistor and this region this region

is called active region active region

and this region here is called

saturation region and the region below

ie equal to zero milliamps is called

cutoff region now there is one very

important thing that I want to explain

you what will happen if we go on

increasing VC B what will happen if we

go on increasing the reverse bias

potential there will be breakdown we

already know in reverse bias condition

if we increase the reverse bias

potential after some time there will be

breakdown and the current will increase

rapidly so if we increase VCB the point

will come when there will be breakdown

and the current will increase rapidly

but this situation never arises because

transistor cannot withstand the high

power being dissipated so this situation

will never arise now if you invert this

plot you will find it is similar to the

reverse biased characteristics of PN

Junction diode you can see this plot is

similar to the reverse bias

characteristics of PN Junction diode the

next thing is the cutoff region in

cutoff region both the diodes are

reverse biased and transistor will

remain off when transistor operates in

this region we can consider transistor

as open switch or logical off in

saturation region both the diodes are

forward biased and we can consider

transistor as closed switch or logical

on you can see collector current IC it

starts to reduce and become zero in

saturation region and this is how we

have to plot the output characteristics

of common base transistor if you have

any doubt you may ask in the comment

section I will end this lecture here see

on the next one
