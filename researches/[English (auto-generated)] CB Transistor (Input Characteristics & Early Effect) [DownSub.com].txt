in the previous lecture I explained the

common base configuration of transistor

now I will explain the early effect the

early effect and by using this we will

plot the input characteristics of common

base transistor the input

characteristics is simply the

characteristics of forward bias diode it

is the characteristics of the forward

biased diode I will explain this point

it is the graphical relation between the

input current and the input voltage for

different values of output voltage it is

the graphical relation between the input

current and the input voltage input

voltage for different for different

output voltages this is what we have in

input characteristics of common base

transistor this is the common base

configuration of the transistor I am

using NPN transistor this is emitter

this is base and this is collector and

we already know in case of NPN

transistor this is the direction of

emitter current ie this is the direction

of base current IB and this is the

direction of collector current IC

I am considering the active mode of

operation so Junction j1 is forward

biased and Junction j2 is reverse biased

this potential difference is equal to V

B II and this potential difference is

equal to VC B I am calling this

configuration common base configuration

because base is common to the input side

and the output side on the input side

the current is ie and the voltage is vbe

so the input current the input current

is simply equal to IE the emitter

current and the input voltage is equal

to vbe the input voltage is equal to vbe

on the output side the current is IC so

the output current is equal to IC the

collector current and VC B is the output

voltage

output voltage is VC B so we have to

plot we have to plot the graphical

relation between ie and vbe for

different values of vc beam now I will

prove the input characteristics of

common base transistor is similar to the

characteristics of forward bias diode I

have already told you we can consider

transistor as two diodes connected back

to back we have NPN transistor so we

have two diodes connected like this this

is an P this is P and so this is like

NPN transistor this is diode d1

this is diode d2 in active mode of

operation diode d1 is forward biased and

diode d2 is reverse biased and we are

plotting the input characteristics input

characteristics is between the input

current and the input voltage for

different values of output voltage the

input current is ie the input voltage is

vbe which is the current and voltage

through and across the diode d1 so we

are simply plotting the forward biased

characteristics of a diode and it is

very simple we can easily plot the

forward biased characteristics for a

diode this axis is for current that is I

II in milliamps the x-axis is for the

voltage across the diode that is v-b-e

and it is measured in volts and the

forward characteristics will simply look

like this let's say the barrier

potential is equal to 0.7 volts because

we are considering silicon as the

semiconductor material we are

considering the silicon diode so barrier

potential is equal to 0.7 volts and this

is the forward bias characteristics of a

diode and this is also the input

characteristics of common base

transistor but the important thing is

the effect on characteristics with

change in VCB let's say this plot is for

VC

II equal to 1 Bowles and now we have to

study the effect on characteristics when

we increase or decrease the output

voltage that is VC being to understand

this effect we first need to understand

the early effect we first need to study

the early effect the early effect very

important concept in analog electronics

this effect is also known as base width

modulation this is also known as base

width modulation and it is named after

James M early after James M early who

discovered early effect in early effect

there is modulation of base width when

we increase the reverse bias voltage VC

B when we increase the reverse bias

voltage VC B there is modulation of base

width this is emitter region this is

base region and this is collector region

Junction j1 is forward biased Junction

j2 is reverse biased and in reverse bias

condition width of depletion layer width

of depletion layer increases and the

depletion layer will penetrate more in

the base region because it is lightly

doped because of light doping hole

concentration is low and easy uncovering

of immobile ions will take place you can

see penetration of depletion layer is

more in base region and this is because

base is lightly doped the depletion

layer will have the negative immobile

ions on the base side because we are

considering an PN transistor and it will

have positive immobile ions on the

collector side because collector is

n-type material let's say let's say W be

W sub B is width of base width of base

or we can call it metallurgical base

width the total width of base region is

equal to W sub B W sub B and let's say

the width of depletion layer

penetrated in the base region is equal

to W and the width of region with no

depletion layer is equal to W effective

from here we can see W B is equal to W

effective W effective plus W so we can

say that W effective is equal to WB

minus W now if we increase VC B the

output voltage or the reverse bias

potential W will increase on increasing

VC B on increasing VC B W will increase

because penetration of depletion layer

will increase in the base region and

when W increases W effective will

decrease W effective will decrease W

effective is the width of region where

recombination takes place this is the

region where recombination takes place

and width of this region is equal to W

effective so when W effective decreases

the chance of recombination in base

region also decreases and this will

increase the input current ie as the

chance of recombination is reducing the

IE will increase the base was thin and

because of penetration of depletion

layer it is now thinner so chance of

recombination reduces and the input

current ie increases the other reason is

increase in concentration gradient the

other reason is increase in

concentration gradient because of

decrement in W effective the

concentration gradient is the main

reason for the movement of charge

carriers the electrons on the N side

will move towards the base because of

concentration gradient as the area is

decreasing the concentration will

definitely increase and because of this

more electrons will flow towards the

base and this will also increase the

input current ie

so we can say that on increasing VC B

the output voltage on increasing VC B

the output voltage the input current

will increase so the final character

stakes including the effect of VCB will

look like this the current ie will

increase with increase in VCB like this

this plot is for VC be equal to 5 volts

VC be equal to 5 volts and this plot is

for VC be equal to 10 volts so with

increase in VC be the input current ie

will also increase and the remaining

thing is similar to the forward bias

characteristics of PN Junction diode I

hope everything explained in this

lecture is clear to you I will end this

lecture here see you in the next one
